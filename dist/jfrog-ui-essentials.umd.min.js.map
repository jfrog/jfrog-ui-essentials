http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html\n *\n * Code a little bit refactored and cleaned (in my humble opinion).\n * Most important changes:\n *  - has an option to highlight only entire words (wordsOnly - false by default),\n *  - has an option to be case sensitive (caseSensitive - false by default)\n *  - highlight element tag and class names can be specified in options\n *\n * Usage:\n *   // wrap every occurrance of text 'lorem' in content\n *   // with <span class='highlight'> (default options)\n *   $('#content').highlight('lorem');\n *\n *   // search for and highlight more terms at once\n *   // so you can save some time on traversing DOM\n *   $('#content').highlight(['lorem', 'ipsum']);\n *   $('#content').highlight('lorem ipsum');\n *\n *   // search only for entire word 'lorem'\n *   $('#content').highlight('lorem', { wordsOnly: true });\n *\n *   // don't ignore case during search of term 'lorem'\n *   $('#content').highlight('lorem', { caseSensitive: true });\n *\n *   // wrap every occurrance of term 'ipsum' in content\n *   // with <em class='important'>\n *   $('#content').highlight('ipsum', { element: 'em', className: 'important' });\n *\n *   // remove default highlight\n *   $('#content').unhighlight();\n *\n *   // remove custom highlight\n *   $('#content').unhighlight({ element: 'em', className: 'important' });\n *\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2009 Bartek Szopka\n *\n * Licensed under MIT license.\n *\n */\n\njQuery.extend({\n    highlight:
